The Official Box-Score (Play-by-Play), for example, significantly serves as an invaluable guide in understanding the analysis of the game on a fundamental level.  With an unbiased precision, the Official Box-Score (Play-by-Play) displays descriptive measurements used to inform how well or how poorly a player and/or team have performed.  With the usage of advanced statistical software tools, I have extended the Official Box-Score and established a never-ending framework that can measure the offensive and defensive prowess for a basketball team, by lineup (overall and per game).  Relative to these measurements of frequency, efficiency, and precision, I will discuss its methodology and display examples of output for the evaluation of player and/or team lineup performance.  Though basketball analytics comes with its limitations and imperfections, the pursuit of the advancement of knowledge of the game further incites ongoing analyses and a penchant for better statistics!
