<h2>Past Talks</h2>
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>April 11th, 11:00am, room KE 403.</b><br>
<u>Speaker</u>: Sujin Kim, School of Industrial Engineering, Purdue University<br><br>
<u>Title</u>: Adaptive Control Variate Methods in Monte Carlo Simulation<br><br>
<u>Abstract</u>:
In this talk we discuss recent results in adaptive control variate methods.
Adaptive Monte Carlo methods are Monte Carlo simulation techniques that aim at improving performance of simulation experiments by adaptively tuning variance reduction methods as the simulation progresses. The primary focus of such techniques has been in adaptively tuning importance sampling distributions to reduce the variance of an estimator. We instead focus on adaptive control variate schemes, developing asymptotic theory for the performance of two adaptive control variate estimators. The first estimator is based on a stochastic approximation scheme for identifying the optimal choice of control variate. It is easily implemented, but its performance is sensitive to certain tuning parameters. The second estimator uses a sample average approximation approach. It has the advantage that it does not require any tuning parameters, but it can be computationally expensive and requires the availability of nonlinear optimization software. We present the numerical results of simulation experiments on pricing of barrier options using these two adaptive methods.
(This is joint work with Shane G. Henderson, Cornell University.)
The talk will conclude with a brief overview of ongoing research efforts and future research directions. Traditionally, power system operation and management involves a variety of challenging decision problems, and new interesting problems have emerged with the restructuring of many electricity markets around the globe. In this context, current research on applications of stochastic optimization algorithms for problems such as unit commitment and strategic bidding is described.

<li><b>February 13th, 11:00am, room KE 403.</b><br>
<u>Speaker</u>: Natalia Yankovic, Columbia University<br><br>
<u>Title</u>: Nurse Staffing: Patients or Patience?<br><br>
<u>Abstract</u>:
Nurse staffing in hospitals is traditionally based on target ratios of patients to nurses. However, varying needs for care based on age, diagnosis, case severity, and medical complexity, as well as emerging evidence relating nursing levels to quality of care have led to the search for better staffing models. This talk will describe a newly developed queuing model for nurse staffing and an on-going hospital-based project to implement it to assure timely nursing responses to patients' needs.

<li><b>February 8th, 11:00am, room KE 403.</b><br>
<u>Speaker</u>: Tim Leung, Princeton University<br><br>
<u>Title</u>: Credit Derivatives and Risk Aversion<br><br>

<p>

<li><b>February 4th, 11:00am, room KE 403.</b><br>
<u>Speaker</u>: Jingchen Liu, Department of Statistics, Harvard University<br><br>
<u>Title</u>: Rare-event Simulation for Heavy-tailed Multi-server Queues<br><br>
<u>Abstract</u>:
In this talk, I will discuss the first provably efficient simulation algorithm for steady-state 
estimation of long delays in a positive recurrent two-server (G/G/2) queue with 
heavy-tailed service requirement. Long delays are usually caused by one or two customers 
(depending on the traffic intensity) who have extremely large service requirement and 
block the servers for long time. We propose a three-step program to design the algorithm 
and prove its efficiency. First, we adopt a mixture family of changes-of-measure; second, 
propose an appropriate Lyapunov inequality to control the variance of our estimator; third, 
construct a Lyapunov function (the solution to the Lyapunov inequality) and tune various 
parameters to verify the inequality. Because of the upper bound provided by the 
Lyapunov function, our method also suggests an asymptotic approximation of the 
rare-event probability. Therefore, rare-event simulation and large deviations analysis for 
heavy-tailed models are connected naturally. Our strategy including the mixture family, 
the construction of Lypunov function, and proof techniques can solve a large class of 
problems. We shall also mention other large deviations problems involving 
multidimensional heavy-tailed models for which our program can be successfully applied.

<li><b>January 18th, 11:00am, room KE 403</b><br>
<u>Speaker</u>: Robert Lund, Department of Mathematical Sciences, Clemson University<br><br>
<u>Title</u>: Periodic Time Series<br><br>
<u>Abstract</u>:
This talk overviews modeling and inference procedures for time series
data
with periodic means and autocovariances.  Such series arise in
hydrology,
meteorology, astronomy, economics, and ecology.  The class of periodic
autoregressive moving-average (PARMA) models is introduced to describe
series with second-order periodicities.  PARMA models are compared and
contrasted to seasonal autoregressive moving-average models.  Testing
for
the presence of second order periodicities, asymptotic properties of
PARMA
parameter estimators, and parsimonious PARMA modeling are central issues
of the talk.  An application to United States temperature trends is
given.<br><br>
