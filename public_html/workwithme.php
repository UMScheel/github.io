<h2>Want to Get Involved?</h2>

Are you a student looking for an interesting research project? Send me an e-mail!
All levels are welcome: undergraduate, master's, or doctoral.
Some computer programming experience (for example, Visual Basic, Python, Java, C/C++) would be a plus, but isn't strictly necessary. It would also help to have some basic knowledge of
   Operations Research (the equivalent of MAS 441 or MAS 632 at UM), but we may be able to take care of that as well. It all depends on your specific interests and the kinds of projects on which I'm working at the moment.
