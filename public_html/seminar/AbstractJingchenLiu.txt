Rare-event Simulation for Heavy-tailed Multi-server Queues

In this talk, I will discuss the first provably efficient simulation algorithm for steady-state 
estimation of long delays in a positive recurrent two-server (G/G/2) queue with 
heavy-tailed service requirement. Long delays are usually caused by one or two customers 
(depending on the traffic intensity) who have extremely large service requirement and 
block the servers for long time. We propose a three-step program to design the algorithm 
and prove its efficiency. First, we adopt a mixture family of changes-of-measure; second, 
propose an appropriate Lyapunov inequality to control the variance of our estimator; third, 
construct a Lyapunov function (the solution to the Lyapunov inequality) and tune various 
parameters to verify the inequality. Because of the upper bound provided by the 
Lyapunov function, our method also suggests an asymptotic approximation of the 
rare-event probability. Therefore, rare-event simulation and large deviations analysis for 
heavy-tailed models are connected naturally. Our strategy including the mixture family, 
the construction of Lypunov function, and proof techniques can solve a large class of 
problems. We shall also mention other large deviations problems involving 
multidimensional heavy-tailed models for which our program can be successfully applied.
