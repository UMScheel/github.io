<h2>Short Bio</h2>
<p>
I grew up in the beautiful city of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil,
where I stayed until finishing high-school.
From there I moved to the city of
Campinas, in the state of S&atilde;o Paulo,
where I received a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering and a
Master's degree in Computer Science from the State University of Campinas (<A
HREF="http://www.unicamp.br">UNICAMP</A>).
While at UNICAMP, I was introduced to
<A HREF="http://www.scienceofbetter.org">Operations
Research</A> by a professor who is now a great friend of mine.
I fell in love with the subject and I decided to steer my career toward
using analytical methods to help people make better decisions.
This led me to western Pennsylvania, where I received a Ph.D. degree
from Carnegie Mellon University's
<A HREF="http://www.tepper.cmu.edu">Tepper School of Business</A>.
I have been a member of the UM faculty since the Fall of 2005.

My <A HREF="yunes-cv.pdf" onMouseOver="window.status='Curriculum Vitae'; return true">Curriculum Vit&aelig;</A> contains more
information, including a complete list of publications, working papers, talks, teaching
experience, and consulting activities.

<h2>Research Interests</h2>
<p>
I am interested in solving optimization problems that arise from
a variety of practical applications, such as:
product line simplification,
scheduling (sports, crews, call centers, manufacturing),
political districting,
information display on maps,
routing and transportation, location,
and operations management in general.
In order to address such problems, I use
<A HREF="http://analytics-magazine.com/?p=1476">Prescriptive Analytics</A>
or, more specifically, tools
from the fields of <A HREF="http://www.scienceofbetter.org">Operations Research</A> (OR) and <A
HREF="http://kti.ms.mff.cuni.cz/~bartak/constraints/">Constraint Programming</A> (CP). 
These tools are essentially mathematical models that contain a
simplified (but still useful) representation of the actual problem in
a way that can be treated (i.e. solved) by a computer.
<P>
Sometimes, standard techniques for solving OR and CP models
are not able to satisfactorily handle the problem at hand, when
considered in isolation.
Hence, part of my research focuses on developing the theory and
facilitating the implementation of optimization algorithms
that integrate multiple solution techniques.
The Spring 2006 issue of the <A HREF="http://www.tepper.cmu.edu/news-multimedia/tepper-magazine/index.aspx">Tepper Magazine</A>
has <a href="docs/tepper-magazine-spring06-simpl.pdf">an article on this topic</a> entitled
"<I>Two disciplines join to optimize solutions to enterprise-wide problems</I>".
To have an idea of what integrated optimization can do for you, take a look at
some <a href="integrated.php" onMouseOver="window.status='Success stories'; return true">success stories</a>.
<p>
More recently, I've also studied ways to simplify product lines while
finding a profitable balance between customer satisfaction and
complexity costs, which include costs related to manufacturing, marketing,
training, etc. The Spring 2008 issue of the
<a href="http://www.bus.miami.edu/news-and-media/publications/bus-miami-mag/index.html">BusinessMiami Magazine</a>
has <a href="docs/businessmiami-magazine-spring08-customization.pdf">an article on this topic</a>
entitled "<i>The Costs of Customization</i>".

<h2>Ph.D. Program in Management Science/Operations Research</h2>
<p>
Our department has recently started accepting applications to the PhD program in Management Science/Operations Research.
The School of Business Administration at the University of Miami offers a challenging and stimulating work environment, talented faculty committed to high quality research, and world-class facilities.
