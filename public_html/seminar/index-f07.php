<h2>Fall of 2007</h2>
<p>
Welcome to the Management Science and Operations Management (MSOM) Seminar
at the School of Business Administration at the University of Miami.

<p>

Here you will find details about the talks given during the Fall of 2007.

<br><br>

<h2>Past Talks</h2>
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>December 14th</b><br>
<u>Speaker</u>: Ling Wang, Management Department, University of Miami<br><br>
<u>Title</u>: Joint Price and Due-Date Quotation: Monopolistic and Competitive Cases<br><br>
<u>Abstract</u>:
We consider a joint due-date and price quotation problem in the make-to-order setting under both 
monopolistic and competitive environments. In the monopolistic model a single firm quotes price and 
due-date to incoming customers. Customers either accept or reject the joint quote according to a 
probabilistic acceptance function.  We show the firm's optimal policy is to promise the earliest available 
due-date and offer a price uniquely determined by its current backlog size. In the competitive model 
two firms compete to win customers by offering a joint quote better than the rival. We provide 
conditions for the existence of Nash equilibria and characterize due-dates and prices at equilibrium. 
We identify and explain a seemingly counter-intuitive behavior - "lose-for-now" - whereby the firm 
with smaller backlog attempts to lose the current customer to the rival. We conduct numerical studies 
to examine the impact of system parameters on prices and expected profits at equilibrium. We 
identify two factors that dampen the competition and lead to high prices: backlog imbalance between 
firms and high utilization.

<li><b>December 4th</b><br>
<u>Speaker</u>: Hernan Awad, Management Science Department, University of Miami<br><br>
<u>Title</u>: Importance Sampling for Markov Process Expectations<br><br>
<u>Abstract</u>:
We study the use of importance sampling (IS) to estimate a class of
expectations of functionals of Markov processes. These expectations
are more general than rare event probabilities, and include the
expected cumulative discounted reward until hitting a set as a
particular case. Experience in the rare-event simulation context
shows that characterizing the form of the zero-variance importance
distribution can often help in designing an efficient importance
sampling estimator. For more general expectations in the Markov
setting, however, the zero-variance importance distribution often
destroys the Markovian nature of the underlying process, making it
difficult to simulate. For the class of expectations we consider, we
show that a zero-variance estimator can be constructed by using an
importance distribution that preserves the Markovian nature of the
underlying process. The importance distribution depends on the
solution of a linear system which characterizes the desired
expectation. This suggests that, if an approximate solution to the
linear system is available, it can be used to construct a good
practical importance sampling distribution that  preserves the
Markovian nature of the underlying process.

The first part of the talk will consist of a brief primer on
importance sampling techniques.

<li><b>November 14th</b><br>
<u>Speaker</u>: John Liechty, Smeal College of Business, Penn State University<br><br>
<u>Title</u>: Attribute Level Heterogeneity: Improving Model Based Clustering by Aggregating Information Along Each Dimension<br><br>
<u>Abstract</u>: 
In the world of marketing, clustering consumer preferences (commonly referred to as consumer 
heterogeneity) has played an important role in understanding market structure and allowing 
practitioners to engage in group and individual level marketing actions.  In practice, this clustering has 
been done using finite mixture models which offers a tool for gaining stylized insights into market 
segments.  Finite mixture models typically cluster 'partworth' utility vectors in P dimensional space - 
assuming that all of the elements of the partworth vector parameters are the same for each mixture 
component, a vector finite mixture model.  We propose and explore an alternate finite mixture 
specification, where each element of the partworth vector has its own finite mixture, an attribute 
finite mixture model.  We address a number of statistical issues, such as contrasting the alternate 
specification with the traditional model and the computational challenges associated with model 
choice for the attribute mixture model.  In addition, we demonstrate that by aggregating information 
along each of the dimensions of the partworth vector, the attribute model is able to identify a complex 
structures with less data, when compared to the vector model; leading to a robust approach to 
segmentation which results in complex market structure that is readily accessible to managers.

<li><b>October 26th</b><br>
<u>Speaker</u>: Amitabh Sinha, Ross School of Business, University of Michigan<br><br>
<u>Title</u>: Integrated Optimization of Procurement, Processing and Trade of Commodities<br><br>
<u>Abstract</u>: We consider an integrated optimization problem for a firm involved in procurement, processing and trading of commodities. We first derive optimal policies for a risk-neutral firm, when the processed commodity(ies) are sold using futures instruments. We find that the optimal procurement quantity is governed by a threshold policy, where the threshold is independent of the starting inventory level, and it is optimal to postpone all processing till the last possible period. We extend the model to include risk-averse firms, using a Value-at-Risk constraint on the total expected profits. We show that the optimal procurement quantity for a risk-averse firm is never greater than that for a risk-neutral firm and a risk-averse firm may find it optimal to process and sell the output commodity in earlier periods. We conduct numerical studies to quantify the benefit from integrated decision making and the impact of risk-aversion on expected profits. (For a copy of the paper contact Tallys Yunes.)<br><br>
<u>About the Speaker</u>: Amitabh Sinha's research interests include logistic network design; social networks and their impact on business innovation; decision making under uncertainty; supply chains; location theory; and product placement. Among other projects, he is currently working on developing models of interactions among employees in corporations, and exploring how the inter-employee social network impacts information flow and innovation in an organization. He is also exploring why, in a competitive market, the first entrant may not always succeed: Along with a colleague, he has found that contrary to popular belief, the market structure could be such that the second entrant always captures greater market-share than the first entrant.<br><br>

<li><b>September 28th</b><br>
<u>Speaker</u>: Nan Kong, Weldon School of Biomedical Engineering, Purdue University<br><br>
<u>Title</u>: Issues and Challenges in Optimal Design for Cadaveric Liver Sharing<br><br>
<u>Abstract</u>: Cadaveric liver transplantation is the only viable therapeutic option for end-stage liver disease patients
who have no living donors. However, this type of transplantation is hindered in the United States by donor
scarcity and organ viability decay. Given these difficulties, the current U.S. liver transplantation and allocation policy attempts to balance allocation likelihood and geographic proximity by allocating cadaveric livers
hierarchically. 
In this talk, we mainly consider the problem of maximizing the intra-regional transplant efficiency
through the design of organ harvesting regions. We formulate the problem as a partitioning problem that
clusters organ procurement organizations (OPOs) into regions. We refine the estimate of viability-adjusted
transplant quantity to capture the tradeoff between large and small regions. Our partitioning formulation
includes too many potential regions to handle explicitly, which leads us to a branch-and-price approach. The
pricing problem is an NP-hard nonlinear 0-1 program for which we provide a linear reformulation and design
a decomposition heuristic to generate promising columns quickly. Finally we present computational studies
that show the benefit of region design and the efficacy of our branch-and-price approach. Our test instances
are generated based on recent clinical data. Almost all instances can be solved within a reasonable amount
of time and the resulting optimal designs indicate an average viability-adjusted increase of nearly 9% over
the current regional configuration. In the remainder of the talk, we present issues and challenges in network 
configuration 
and policy design for the U.S. organ transplantation and allocation system.<br><br>
<u>About the Speaker</u>: Nan Kong is an Assistant Professor in the Weldon School of Biomedical Engineering at Purdue University. He joined Purdue BME in August 2007.
