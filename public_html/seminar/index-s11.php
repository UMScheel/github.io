<ul>

<li><b>April 24th, 10:30am, room SB 208</b><br>
<u>Speaker</u>: Tallys Yunes, Department of Management Science, University of Miami<br><br>
<u>Title</u>: Tutorial: Introduction to Constraint Programming<br><br>
<u>Abstract</u>: The purpose of this talk is to provide faculty and students with a brief introduction to Constraint Programming (CP).
CP is a modeling and solution paradigm that can be used to address constraint satisfaction and optimization problems.
It started to gain popularity in the 80's and it has been used extensively in industry. CP differs from traditional modeling
approaches such as Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) because it has a richer vocabulary of constraints and it uses logical
inference during the search for a solution. CP provides an alternative way to attack difficult problems and its strengths are
complementary to those of MILP. No prior knowledge of CP is required.

<u>Speaker</u>: Tallys Yunes, Department of Management Science, University of Miami<br><br>
<u>Title</u>: Valid Inequalities for the Cumulative Constraint and the Cumulative
Job Shop Scheduling Problem<br><br>
<u>Abstract</u>:
In Constraint Programming, the cumulative global constraint is used to
describe scheduling problems in which a machine can process more than one
job at a time. We study the convex hull of feasible solutions to the
cumulative constraint when (i) jobs are identical, and (ii) jobs differ in
their resource utilization rates. In the first case, we revisit some of the
previous work found in the literature; in the second case, we propose a new
family of facet-defining inequalities. We also present computational results
obtained with a branch-and-cut algorithm for cumulative scheduling, including
a cumulative version of the well-known job shop scheduling problem.
This is joint work with Dimitrios Magos and Ioannis Mourtos.

<u>Title</u>: Managing Opportunistic Supplier Product Adulteration: Deferred Payments, Inspection, and Combined Mechanisms<br><br>
<u>Abstract</u>:
Recent cases of product adulteration by foreign suppliers have compelled many manufacturers to re-think approaches to deterring suppliers from cutting corners, especially when manufacturers cannot fully monitor and control the suppliers' actions. Recognizing that process certification programs, such as ISO9000, do not guarantee unadulterated products and that product liability and product warranty with foreign suppliers are rarely enforceable, manufacturers turn to mechanisms that make payments to the suppliers contingent on no defects discovery. In this paper we study: (a) the deferred payment mechanism --- the buyer pays the supplier after the deferred payment period only if no adulteration has been discovered by the customers; (b) the inspection mechanism --- the buyer pays the supplier immediately, contingent on product passing the inspection; and (c) the combined mechanism --- a combination of the deferred payment and inspection mechanisms. We find the optimal contracts for each mechanism, and describe the Nash equilibria of inspection sub-games for the inspection and the combined mechanisms. The inspection mechanism cannot completely deter the suppliers from product adulteration, while the deferred payment mechanism can. Surprisingly, the combined mechanism is redundant: either the inspection or the deferred payment mechanisms perform just as well. Finally, the four factors that determine the dominance of deferred payment mechanism over the inspection mechanism are: (a) the inspection cost relative to inspection accuracy, (b) the buyer's liability for adulterated products, (c) the difference in financing rates for the buyer and the supplier relative to the defects discovery rate by customers, and (d) the difference in production costs for adulterated and unadulterated product.
Joint work with Volodymyr Babich, Georgetown University

<li><b>March 11</b><br>
<u>Speaker</u>: Jochen K&ouml;nemann, Department of Combinatorics and Optimization, University of Waterloo, Canada<br><br>
<u>Title</u>: Approximating Steiner Trees via Linear Programming<br><br>
<u>Abstract</u>:
This talk focuses on the classical Steiner tree problem, where one is given a weighted undirected graph G and a vertex subset R of so called terminals. The goal is to find the cheapest tree T that spans R, and may contain other, so called Steiner vertices. This problem has numerous applications, and is well known to be NP-hard to solve exactly. This talk focuses on finding fast approximation algorithms for the problem. Very recently, some very elegant new algorithms have been proposed; these are based on strong linear programming relaxations and random sampling. I will survey these LP relaxations, discuss some of their properties, and describe their algorithmic use. Some of the results presented are based on joint work with David Pritchard, and Deeparnab Chakrabarty.

<u>Speaker's Short Bio</u>:
Jochen K&ouml;nemann spent his undergraduate years in Saarbruecken, Germany, where he studied Computer Science in Kurt Mehlhorn's group at the Max-Planck Institute. He then moved on to Pittsburgh, where he became a student in the graduate program for Algorithms, Combinatorics & Optimization. After a postdoctoral year at University of Rome in Italy, he moved on to the University of Waterloo in Canada, where he is now an Associate Professor and Chair in the Department of Combinatorics & Optimization. Jochen's research focuses broadly on efficient algorithms for NP-hard optimization problems. He is particularly interested in problems arising in the areas of network design and in algorithmic game theory.

<li><b>February 18</b><br>
<u>Speaker</u>: Jonas Baeklund, Department of Mathematical Sciences, University of Aarhus, Denmark<br><br>
<u>Title</u>: Nurse Rostering in a Danish Hospital<br><br>
<u>Abstract</u>:
Nurse rostering is the complex scheduling problem of
planning which shift each nurse should work over a number of consecutive of days.
The problem we confront is a nurse rostering problem in a ward at a Danish
hospital. The problem includes several special regulations that have
to be fulfilled in this ward. This presentation will discuss the first
results of the on-going work of my Ph.D. thesis project. It gives
an overview on the solution approach we are currently working
on. The overall method is a branch-and-price algorithm based on a
linear master problem and a sub-problem handled with heuristics and
constraint programming.

<u>Speaker</u>: Yongtao Guan, Division of Biostatistics, Yale University<br><br>
<u>Title</u>: Estimating Individual-Level Risk in Spatial Epidemiology Using Spatially Aggregated Information on the Population at Risk<br><br>
<u>Abstract</u>:
We propose a novel alternative to case-control sampling for the estimation of individual-level risk in spatial epidemiology. Our approach uses weighted estimating equations to estimate regression parameters in the intensity function of an inhomogeneous spatial point process, when information on risk-factors is available at the individual level for cases, but only at a spatially aggregated level for the population at risk. We develop data-driven methods to select the weights used in the estimating equations and show through simulation that the choice of weights can have a major impact on efficiency of estimation. We develop a formal test to detect non-Poisson behavior in the underlying point process and assess the performance of the test using simulations of Poisson and Poisson cluster point processes. We apply our methods to data on the spatial distribution of childhood meningococcal disease cases in Merseyside, U.K. between 1981 and 2007.
