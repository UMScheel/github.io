Dear Madeline,
<p>
Here you can see how professors are really busy, because after lunch they need to take a little break to play with their web cam in their office.
But don't be fooled by the empty desk, there's plenty going on on the white board.
<p>
Given that you told me that a nice smile is important to you, and none of my online pictures is good at that, I decided to give you a sample to see if I pass the test :-) Pay close attention to the photo captions.

When I was notified I had been matched to Madeline, and then saw her beautiful picture.<br><br>

In honor of Madeline, who loves coffee. You can also see that my nails are clean :-)<br><br>

After my students saw their midterm exam grades. Still happy though, because I remembered I was going to have dinner with Madeline :-)<br><br>
<p>
The End.
<p>
P.S. Do you like popcorn? How about chocolate?
