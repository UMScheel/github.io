<u>Title</u>: Information Sharing in a Supply Chain with a Common Retailer and Production Diseconomies<br><br>
<u>Abstract</u>:
We consider a supply chain with two competing manufacturers selling substitutable products through a common retailer.  Both manufacturers face diseconomies of scale in production.  The retailer decides whether to share a private imperfect demand signal with any of the two manufacturers before observing the signal. A multi-stage game is formulated to analyze how the firms make information sharing, wholesale price and retail price decisions.  We consider several scenarios where the retailer or the manufacturers are the leaders in information sharing decisions and study how such leadership affects the equilibrium outcome. We also perform sensitivity analysis to investigate how different parameters impact the information sharing decisions as well as the performance of the firms.

<u>Title</u>:
The Concave Cost Supply Management Problem:
Branch and Bound Method with Subproblems
Solvable by Inspection
<br><br>
<u>Abstract</u>:
The concave cost supply management problem (P) is a special global optimization
problem that seeks to minimize a concave cost function over a disconnected nonconvex
set. In this article, we present and validate a branch and bound algorithm for globally
solving problem (P). The algorithm has several advantages. First, the linear programming
subproblems that it generates can be solved essentially by inspection. Second, the algorithm
is guaranteed to either find an exact globally optimal solution for problem (P) or show that
problem (P) is infeasible. Third, the algorithm is finite. Last, the algorithm does not require
that any special conditions hold on the functions or data of problem (P). These properties
are all verified in the article and a sample problem is solved.

<li><b>October 8</b><br>
<u>Speaker</u>: Mac Dada, Carey Business School, Johns Hopkins University<br><br>
<u>Title</u>: A Framework for Supply Chain Coordination<br><br>
<u>Abstract</u>:
This work begins with the analysis of a single link involving a monopolist Supplier, and a single Newsvendor. We focus on a general setting in which each player incurs non-negative economic costs which may include both fixed and variable portions. These values may be direct costs associated with value-adding activities, allocated costs through various accounting schemes, reservation profit levels, or some mixture of the three. Given this structure, we develop a graphical representation to show and explain to the reader/user/manager what constitutes a feasible contract as well as a Pareto-optimal contractual arrangement. We then develop two archetypal contract forms that coordinate this link. We refer to one as a Fixed Tariff Contract, in which the supplier guarantees itself a fixed payoff above its reservation profit level. The other is a Contribution Sharing Contract in which the supplier demands a fixed proportion of the expected contribution above the reservation profit levels. Next we show how several commonly used contract forms are instances or derivatives of these archetypal forms. Following that, we show how an understanding/use of these contract forms provides insights applicable to several current research topics in supply-chain management including cases involving a price-setting Newsvendor, a Newsvendor that affects demand via sales efforts, and contracting with the Newsvendor in the presence of asymmetric demand or cost information. Finally we explain how the application of these archetypal contract forms can be extended over several links forming a serial chain, as well as over a network of chains. We label such networks as Newsvendor Supply Chains. The results provide a useful mental model for characterizing supply-chain interactions.

<u>Title</u>:
Analytical Approximations to Predict the Performance Measures of Manufacturing Systems with Job Failures and Parallel Processing
<br><br>
<u>Abstract</u>:
Parallel processing is prevalent in many manufacturing and service systems. Many
manufactured products are built and assembled from several components fabricated
in parallel lines. An example of this manufacturing system configuration is observed
at a manufacturing facility equipped to assemble and test web servers. Characteristics
of a typical web server assembly line are: multiple products, job circulation,
and paralleling processing. The primary objective of this research was to develop
analytical approximations to predict performance measures of manufacturing systems
with job failures and parallel processing. The analytical formulations extend
previous queueing models used in assembly manufacturing systems in that they can
hadle serial and different configurations of paralleling processing with multiple product
classes, and job circulation due to random part failures. In addition, appropriate
correction terms via regression analysis were added to the approximations in order
to minimize the gap in the error between the analytical approximation and the simulation
models. Markovian and general type manufacturing systems, with multiple
product classes, job circulation due to failures, and fork and join systems to model
parallel processing were studied. In the Markovian and general case, the approximations
without correction terms performed quite well for one and two product problem
instances. However, it was observed that the flow time error increased as the number
of products and net traffic intensity increased. Therefore, correction terms for
single and fork-join stations were developed via regression analysis to deal with more
than two products. The numerical comparisons showed that the approximations perform
remarkably well when the corrections factors were used in the approximations.
In general, the average flow time error was reduced from 38.19% to 5.59% in the
Markovian case, and from 26.39% to 7.23% in the general case. All the equations
stated in the analytical formulations were implemented as a set of Matlab scripts.
By using this set, operations managers of web server assembly lines, manufacturing
or other service systems with similar characteristics can estimate different system
performance measures, and make judicious decisions - especially setting delivery due
dates, capacity planning, bottleneck mitigation, among others.
